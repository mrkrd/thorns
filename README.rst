With *thorns* you can analyze and display `spike trains`_ generated by
neurons.  It can be useful for the analysis of experimental and
simulation data using Python.  For example, you can easily calculate
peristimulus time histogram (PSTH), interspike time histogram (ISIH),
vector strength (VS), entrainment and visualize action potentials with
raster plot.

*waves* is a submodule with some useful signal processing and
generation functions, e.g. generate ramped tone, amplitude modulation
tone, FFT filter, set level (dB_SPL).

The software was originally developed during my PhD in the group of
`Werner Hemmert`_ at the TUM.  It is oriented towards auditory
research, but it could be easily extended.

Usage
-----

Don't forget to check our IPython Notebook DEMO_ and scripts in the
examples_ directory!

Initialize and load spike trains::

  import thorns as th
  from thorns.datasets import load_anf_zilany2014

  spike_trains = load_anf_zilany2014()



Calculate vector strength::

  th.vector_strength(spike_trains, freq=1000)



Raster plot::

  th.plot_raster(spike_trains)
  th.show()



Generate and plot AM tone::

  import thorns.waves as wv

  sound = wv.amplitude_modulated_tone(
      fs=48e3,
      fm=100,
      fc=1e3,
      m=0.7,
      duration=0.1,
  )

  wv.plot_signal(sound, fs=48e3)

  wv.show()

Features
--------

- Analyzes and displays spike trains
- Uses pandas.DataFrame as the main data container (spike trains,
  results)
- Handy signal processing and generating functions: ``thorns.waves``
- Map implementation with various backend (also parallel) and caching:
  ``thorns.util.map()``
- Dumpdb: quickly dump ``map()``'s results in one script and load from
  another one: ``thorns.util.dumpdb()``, ``thorns.util.loaddb()``
- Pure Python





Installation
------------

In order to use *thorns*, you'll need to install the following
dependencies first:

- Python (2.7)
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

- py-notify (optional, enables notifications)


Next, type in your command line::

   pip install thorns
